## Salami

My friend Dan cures home-made salami.

Dan needs:

- a front end to manage a Raspberry Pi which controls his fridge's thermostat and humidifier

- a database to store recipes, and

- an inexpensive deployment so he can see what's happening wherever he is

So I'm going to use Next.js for the front-end, PostgreSQL for the db, and AWS for the deployment.

Let's go :)
